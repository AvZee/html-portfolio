<hr>
<h3>Brat 2</h3>
<p>A very interesting take of Russian views on the United States in an almost "so bad, it's good" quality</p>
<h3>Brat 1</h3>
<p>A cult classic Russian criminal movie that acts as a zeitgeist of post-collapse 1990's Russia</p>
<h3>SpiderMan: Across The Spiderverse</h3>
<p>Very well stylized and a very fun movie to watch</p>
