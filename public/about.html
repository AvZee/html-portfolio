<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am a student at UC Santa Cruz pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.
  As I navigate my personal journey through the nuances of the Computer Science field,
  I hope to discover my true passion and utilize my creativity in the creation of a 
  happier, more colorful world as I move into my career. I hope to get the oppurtunity
  to display my skills in a hands-on role in the future and am optimistic about what the
  future holds in store for me.
